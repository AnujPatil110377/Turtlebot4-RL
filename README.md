# Turtlebot4-RL

A reinforcement learning environment for TurtleBot4 navigation and SLAM using ROS 2 and Gazebo.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive RL environment for TurtleBot4 robot navigation and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) tasks. Built on top of ROS 2 and Gazebo simulation, it offers a robust platform for developing and testing reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous navigation.

## Attribution

This work is built upon and extends the foundational work from [anurye/gym-turtlebot](https://github.com/anurye/gym-turtlebot). We acknowledge and appreciate the initial implementation that served as the starting point for this enhanced version.
